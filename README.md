This To-Do List web application is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend, and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB on the backend.

The system includes user authentication, allowing users to register and log in before accessing their personal to-do list. Once logged in, users can create tasks with a title, optional description, and due date, view all their tasks retrieved from the API, update and edit tasks, mark them as complete or incomplete and delete them. 

All data is stored through secure API calls, not local storage. The app also highlights overdue tasks and can trigger due-date notifications.

To run the project, start MongoDB, run the backend server and open the frontend HTML file in a browser.

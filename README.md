This is a basic To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript on the frontend, with a Node.js, Express, and MongoDB backend. 

The app allows users to create tasks with a title, description, and due date, view all tasks from the API, update or edit existing tasks, mark tasks as complete or incomplete, and delete tasks.

All data is stored through API calls instead of local storage, and the interface also highlights overdue tasks and can show due-date notifications.
